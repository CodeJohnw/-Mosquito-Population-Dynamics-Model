# -Mosquito-Population-Dynamics-Model
This model incorporates various factors including delays in developmental stages, environmental carrying capacity, and control measures such as insecticides or biological control. The primary goal of the model is to simulate and understand the effects of these factors on adult mosquito populations over time.
